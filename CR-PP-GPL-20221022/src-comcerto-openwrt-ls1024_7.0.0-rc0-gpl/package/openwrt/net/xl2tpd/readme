Changes:

(1)  Patch (111-FSL-cmm-notify.patch): is used to notify CMM of a ppp interface that has come up. 
   The notigfication is made when a SIGUSR2 signal is received by xl2tpd. This SIGUSR2 can be 
   triggered by sending a "kill -12 ` cat /var/run/xl2tpd.pid`" whenever a pppol2tp interface comes up.

(2) Makefile: Altered to link to cmm library.
(3) Makefile: dependancy updated from ip to ip-full.
